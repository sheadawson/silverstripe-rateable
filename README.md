silverstripe-rateable
=====================

An extension that adds a star rating system + UI to any DataObject type 

## Requirements

Silverstripe 4

## Installation

``
composer require sheadawson/silverstripe-rateable 2.0.x@stable
``

Apply the Rateable DataExtension to the Objects you want to rate. ie. in mysite/_config/config.yml

	Page:
	  extensions:
	    - SheaDawson\Rateable\Extensions\Rateable

Then in your templates you can use $RateableUI, when in the context of your rateable object to render the star rating UI. If you have multiple instances of the same DataObject + RateableUI on one page, you can pass in a unique identifier string to $RateableUI, ie. $RateableUI('footer').

Run dev/build?flush=all

## Sorting objects by rating 

```php
$pages = Page::get();
$sortedPages = singleton('RateableService')->sortByRating($pages);
```
## Disabling by default on some page types

If you have added this extension to the `Page` class, it's enabled by default on *all* pages. But on some page types this might be annoying, e.g. ErrorPage or some holders. You can disable $RateableUI by default on this pages by adding this to your config.yml:

	ErrorPage:
	  defaults:	
	    EnableRatings: 0
	    
You can still enable it on some pages of this type by hand in the "Settings" section.
